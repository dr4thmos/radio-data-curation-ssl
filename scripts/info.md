# `outputs/`

This directory contains the outputs from each stage of the data processing pipeline.

**Note:** The outputs from the self-supervision stage are managed separately in the `solo-learn-radio` repository.

## Directory Structure

*   **`cutouts/`**
    Contains the raw image cutouts generated by the pipeline. Each subfolder corresponds to a run and includes:
    -   `*.npy` files: The image cutouts.
    -   `info.json`: A metadata file describing the cutouts and how to access them.

*   **`merged_cutouts/`**
    Stores merged metadata from one or more cutout generation processes. This is used to combine cutouts from different runs (e.g., using different resolutions) into a single logical dataset, represented by a unified `info.json` file.

*   **`features/`**
    Contains features extracted from the cutouts defined in `merged_cutouts/`. Each subfolder corresponds to a feature extraction run using a specific model. The features are saved in HDF5 (`.h5`) or NumPy (`.npy`) format.

*   **`clusters/`**
    Stores the results of the clustering algorithm (Vo et al) performed on the extracted features. The process is configured via files in `configs/clusters/`. This directory also contains data subsamples extracted from the resulting clusters.

## A Note on Other Artifacts

UMAP visualizations and cluster-specific statistics are generated from this data but are stored in separate top-level `umap/` and `statistics/` directories for better organization.

## A Note on Naming Conventions

While the pipeline relies on unique hashes and IDs for precise experiment tracking, this can make navigating the directories challenging. We are working on incorporating more descriptive folder names to improve overall readability.
