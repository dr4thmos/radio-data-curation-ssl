# Radio Data Curation for Self-Supervised Learning

This project provides a standalone pipeline for curating astronomical radio survey data. It leverages pre-trained deep learning models to extract features from raw data, which are then used in an unsupervised workflow of clustering and sampling to produce a smaller, high-quality, curated dataset.

The primary function of this repository is to serve as a general-purpose tool for dataset refinement and analysis. It can operate independently to create datasets suitable for a variety of downstream machine learning tasks.

This pipeline is also designed to be compatible with the [solo-learn-radio](https://github.com/dr4thmos/solo-learn-radio) repository, a separate project dedicated to training Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) models on radio astronomical data. The curated datasets generated by this pipeline are ideal inputs for training such models. The relationship and potential workflows are further detailed in the architecture guide and in the context of research presented in arXiv:2411.14078.

This documentation provides all necessary information to set up the environment and operate the pipeline.

## Quick Start

For new users, the recommended path for understanding and using this project is as follows:

1.  **Environment Setup:** Begin by configuring the required `venv` environments as detailed in **[GUIDE_Setup.md](./GUIDE_Setup.md)**. This is a mandatory first step.
2.  **Pipeline Tutorial:** Follow the end-to-end example in **[GUIDE_Pipeline_Usage.md](./GUIDE_Pipeline_Usage.md)** to learn how to run a complete workflow.
3.  **Architecture Details:** For a deeper understanding of the data flow and concepts, refer to **[EXPLANATION_Architecture.md](./EXPLANATION_Architecture.md)**.
